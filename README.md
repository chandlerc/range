A Range STL Extension
=====================

This provides an extension to the standard library implementing a proposed
range-based collection of interfaces. The goal of this library is to provide
example code for a proposal to the standard library. A secondary goal is to
provide the basis of an implementation of these extensions for libcxx[1].
Eventually, this code will be proposed for inclusion into libcxx proper, and as
such the license requirements and some of the style elements follow its lead.
However, the style is optimized for readability in this early version, the
symbol hardening will take place later.
